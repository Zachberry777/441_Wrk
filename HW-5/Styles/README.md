Homework repo
This week was pretty hard for me, I did have to post to the issue board a couple times. Mark Lannen helped me alot and the stuff he told me to do really did help me with most of it. Its not perfect and i still need help with it but i put alot of time into this and I just need to fix one last thing and it will be perfect. So i am typing this part after five minutes later and Mark just helped me figure it our. He spent alot of his own time helping me and i feel like he deserves bonus points for helping me out for awhile.
