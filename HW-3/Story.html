     Its quiet and everybody is either dead or hiding in the Nostromo. Its been a week now since that creature has boarded our ship.
     <br>
     More then 70 people already dead or taken down to the 1st floor of the ship. The Nostromo is huge but yet I feel like its so tiny.
     <br>
     Every time I take a step out of hiding to move on I feel as the creature is still there, watching me. But I cant stay here any longer.
     <br>
     I must get across the station to call for help then take a life pod out of here. So here goes nothing.
     <br>
     I am heading down the first hall now, I must keep my eyes and ears ready. I made it down the hall and I must go left or right.
     <br>
     But on my left its so dark I wont be able to see anything. But on my right I heard screaming. Which way should I go?
