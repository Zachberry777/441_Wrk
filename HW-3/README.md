Im really enjoying this assignment. This is the most fun i have had in any coding class. Its really cool to see my story turn into an interactive game. Again as always i did have trouble and it was small miner things to fix like spelling or a capital, and it would take forever to find that small mistake even though i would use console.log. I am catching up and its making me excited and ive been working hard on this story and want to keep adding on until the story is finished fully. I did put more story into this and with each click, it would add a new part and new image everytime, to set the scene even better. I did accidently save it in my HW-3 but its to late to change it so here is HW-4
