Homework repo
This week was actually really fun. I really enjoyed coming up with a fun stroy. It was cool to turn the story into a game. I wanted to go a diffrent way with the story. Instead of asking basic question, i wanted to make it into a scary game instead.
I wanted the people reading it to really focus on what is going on. I did have troubles with this part. I would spend hours trying to figure out why the consle logs wouldnt work. Then i would go back to the videos and find small mistakes. On some areas i actually went to google and watched more youtube videos on how to fix some things. I feel like im still missing things. But over all i am happy.
