This week was alot better for me. I had a better understanding of what was going on this time. I got all of it except for not leaving the page, i could'nt figure it out. I didnt have to much trouble with this one. The video really helped and i was able to figure out most of the assignment after the video was done. I also did the Kahoot challenge and had alot of fun with this. I feel like we should do more of these because i feel like it helps and its fun having that competative part to it. I retook the challenge just to learn from my mistakes. I will be working on the final project this week when im back from Bozeman.
