This week was the hardest coding i have ever been in. I looked at alot of peoples read me's and it seemed like most of everyone really struggled for this assignment. It was very confusing and i did everything i could with this. It was hard and i worked on it for along time. I came back to it through out the days of spring break to watch videos and work on it but it was verty tough. I just hope next week is not as bad as this week. But i worked my hardest and best i could for this and atleast i got something in this done and not trying at all. Trying counts as something i hope.
