 <br>
 Hello...HELLO! Is anyone there? My name is Dustin Walker. I..I woke up here and have no idea where I am. Please, anybody here!
 <br>
 I guess there's nobody here. Damn this place looks creepy as hell. what is this...An asylum? I should probably get up and look for a way out.
 <br>
 Looks like there's a gate close by, I'll go check it out. (walks over to gate.) Damn it's locked, how did I even get here?
 <br>
 I better find a different way out. I could go up to the doors in the Asylum, but they look like they are barricaded shut.
 <br>
 Which way should I go? I can go left and climb through the window, or I can go right to see what's around the corner.
