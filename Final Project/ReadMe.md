This was by far the most fun I have had In coding so far. It was fun coming up with a story and putting things together to make it fun. It took alot of work. When I do work in the past I finished it in one day, But this project took me about four to five days to finish total and it was fun. I had to gather all the images and come up with a story. I also wanted to make this game have more feel to it and i finished the story. It has two diffrent endings and i added music to this game. I didn't know how to add music so i had to look it up and i managed to do it. I also had difficulties with where things went and got confused but after looking my work over for 20 minutes I figuered things out. I had alot of fun and i feel like I've come a long ways. I had a bad start to the class becasue of my wife and I with the hostpital. You were kind enough to understand and i went from an F to an A in the class with hard work. I just wanted to say you are one of my favorite proffesors ive had in my four years of college. Ive never told any proffesor that until now. So thank you for being Kind and also being very good at teaching what you do. I understood alot more of coding this year and accomplished a lot. Thanks again!
