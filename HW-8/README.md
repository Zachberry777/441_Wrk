This week was actually pretty tough for me with the images and getting the squares to move. At the beginging i got them to move, but as i got to an end i could not. I had trouble with my html file to link with the css and the Js at first and i posted again in the issues board and mark ended up helping me again. He told me i should put them in seprate folders to see if that would help reconize them better and it did. So i learned that i should have seprate folders for all my things so they are easier to reconize. Thats was something i learned this week. I looked at alot of peoples issues and it seems like everyone had a pretty hard time this week. I have alot of trouble with coding and this is my third class on it i think and it never gets easier. But i do end up learning more about it. I find this class more fun then the ones in the past, mainly because i feel like you care and want the students to have fun learning. So even though the coding is hard and brain aching, you make it better and just more fun and i thank you for that!
