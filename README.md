I had alot of trouble this week. It took me awhile To get the hang of all this again. Its been a good year or so since ive coded anything. Coding has always been my weaker side. But as always i still work hard and try to do it to the best of my ability. I kept going back to the videos, and all the reading to get this done. I also practice with the things that were on the web pages. I almost gave up and went in for help after 3 hours of struggling. But i went back and gave it another try and after 20 minutes i got it down, for the most part.
